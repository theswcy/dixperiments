## Little tutorial...

- In your browser, on the discord website ( or Discord **PTB** / **Canary** clients ).
  - `ctrl shift i` on Windows to open the **console**.
  - `command option k` on MacOS to open the  **console**.
- Copy the code located in the `script.js` file and paste it into the **console**.
- Press **enter** and close the **console**.

## Note:

- Make sure to use the code on a **secondary account**, most experiments are visual and will be removed once the page is restarted. **However**, some experiments may remain in the account even after restart, **be careful**!
